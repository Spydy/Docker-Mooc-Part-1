This is my Python 3 programming environment for Ubuntu 18.04.

It installs all necessary packages to start developing Python applications and it also supports Python virtual environments and pip. It only supports Python 3 and makes python command in terminal to automatically mean python3.

The container starts inside your home folder which contains a pre-made workspace folder where you can start building your python projects.

The container also contains the vim editor (even if the instructions said to exclude editors, I thought adding vim was a nice addon so you can develop things inside the container).

Happy programming!
